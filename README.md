# EDGE_DETECTION
To reduce complexity in the design it is divided into four smaller modules. Controller module controls all the significant control signals in the design on its command the first nine 8 bit pixels according to sobel convolution will be sent to and stored in registers of Image_data module and after storing the elements upon the command of controller these elements  are sent to the Calculate_XY_Gradients module where the x and y derivatives are calculated and the sum of both derivatives after thresholding is stored in the memory which can also been accessed for reading purpose the whole read and write operation are controlled by ram_cotrol module.
Whole_Controller:
controller handles and controls all other units in the system and synchronises different operations. On receiving the start signal the controller sends a fetch request for fetching 8 bit binary pixels and after completing the fetch the Image_data module send a fetch complete acknowledgement on receiving this the controller starts the x and y gradients calculation  operation is performed by convoluting the original image pixels with sobel x and y filters  after  calculating the Gxy from x, y gradients the Gxy data is sent to ram1_control which sends an acknowledgment(conv_out) to controller on which the controller sends a signal to fetch the data for 2nd  pixel and this process follows until completion of 100100 pixel calculation.
Image_Data:
Image_data 
The main purpose of this module is to fetch store and send Image data on receiving fetch (Pixel_fetch) ack from controller it starts fetching  pixel data and stores in 3 different 24-bit registers after fetching all 9 elements of first matrix it sends a fetch complete ack (pixel_data_comp) to the controller and after receiving a ack from controller (start operation)  it starts sending all the  elements to the xy_gradients module after sending all the elements it goes back to idle state waiting for further instructions. 
Calculate_XY_Gradients module
 XY_Gradients module handles the convolution calculation of x and y gradients and thresholding operations on receiving the start operation ack from controller it convolutes the 3X3 pixel elements from image data with x and y sobel filters  calculating the x and y gradients these x and y gradient absolute values are added and the threshold of this sum gives Gxy value  which it sends to ram1_control module with an acknowledgement and finally it moves back to idle state waiting for further instructions.
RAM_control Module
The main purpose of this module is to control read/write to memory. Whenever it receives the output pixel from xy_gradients module it also receives an acknowledgement signal to for write operation as we are using 2 different memories (9600x64 and 4800x64) and each memory location ahs 64 bit space in order to avoid the space 8 pixels have been written in each location this is done by using a 64 bit register whenever this module receives output pixel and ack from 
xy_gradients module it stores the data in register when the register is full the data will be written to memories once complete data is written ie 100100 pixels it starts reading the data by moving to read data
