# EDGE_DETECTION
To reduce complexity in the design it is divided into four smaller modules. Controller module controls all the significant control signals in the design on its command the first nine 8 bit pixels according to sobel convolution will be sent to and stored in registers of Image_data module and after storing the elements upon the command of controller these elements  are sent to the Calculate_XY_Gradients module where the x and y derivatives are calculated and the sum of both derivatives after thresholding is stored in the memory which can also been accessed for reading purpose the whole read and write operation are controlled by ram1_cotrol module.
